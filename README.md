# IsCentrelinkDown Blocked Call Statistics Project

As an increasing number of Australians are unable to get through to Centrelink whilst our government keeps on reccomending to call Centrelink there are some obvious issues that are not being addressed.

This project ultimately aims to replicate the results of a very patient person that has to phone centrelink phone numbers all day.

But as it's not a person it doesn't need to stay on the line to talk to an operator - so it will hang up once it detects that it is in queue.

repeating the process ad nauseam until centrelink close.

For more information on why this exists please see our #NotMyDebt senate submission - We're number 27.

## What's inside these files?

Each file (seperated by year) contains the result of each call attempt from 20/06/2017 that the @CentrelinkDown server has made.

It's in a comma seperated values format - Header rows are in order:
Phone number called, Whether the call got through, Test Day of the Week, Test Month, Test Date, Test Time, Test Week Number 

I have also included the actual code I did to create this during the testing that happened.

For your statistical analysis and graphing pleasure!

You can line up the phone numbers by looking at centrelink's phone us page here:
